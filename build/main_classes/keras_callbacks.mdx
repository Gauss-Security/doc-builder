# Keras callbacks

When training a Transformers model with Keras, there are some library-specific callbacks available to automate common
tasks:

## PushToHubCallback

<a id='transformers.keras_callbacks.PushToHubCallback'></a>
> **class transformers.keras\_callbacks.PushToHubCallback**(output_dir: typing.Union[str, pathlib.Path], save_strategy: typing.Union[str, transformers.trainer_utils.IntervalStrategy] = 'epoch', save_steps: typing.Optional[int] = None, tokenizer: typing.Optional[transformers.tokenization_utils_base.PreTrainedTokenizerBase] = None, hub_model_id: typing.Optional[str] = None, hub_token: typing.Optional[str] = None)
